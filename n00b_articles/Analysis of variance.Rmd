## Used parameters in analysis of variance

**MSG** - Mean square between groups --> describes variability between groups

**MSE** - Mean square error --> describes variability within groups

**F** = MSG/MSE = ratio of variability in the sample means relative to the variability within the groups

The *F-Statistic* comes with two degrees of freedom : *df1* and *df2*

*df1* = k - 1 (number of groups minus one)

*df2* = n - k (combined sample size minus number of groups)
