# DBINOM

**dbinom is useful for providing the probability of exact K successes in N trials at probability of success P**

**The situation**:
According to a poll, 38% of people are dumb. What is the probability that in a random sample of 10 people exactly 6 people are dumb?

**The numbers**:

* probability = 38%

* number of successes = 6

* number of trials = 10


**dbinom's variables**:

* x = number of successes = 6

* size = number of trials = 10

* prob = probability = 0.56

**Formula used**: dbinom(x=6,size=10,prob=0.56)
